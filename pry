  'someClass#instance_method' Call the method on instances of the class
  'require 'pry'; binding.pry  hotkey = \p

commands

help - See what commands you can run
whereami - Show code surrounding the current context.
! - Clear the input buffer, use when you typed something incorrectly and want to get out of it
ls -v obj - Show all the methods and variables on other objects
show-source - Show the source for a method or class. SUPER USEFUL!!
cd obj - Change context into obj (sets self to that object)
cd .. - Change context back out of that object.
ls -v - Show all the methods and variables on self
edit - Allows you to edit code without rerunning the program. I use it to put another pry into a method that I'm about to call.
exit - Quit out of current pry session. C-D also works.
exit! - Quit the program
